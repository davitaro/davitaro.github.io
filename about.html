    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <image src="Images/profile.jpg" alt="profile pic" title="that's me" width="200" height="300" class="roundborder floatleft"></image>
    <p style="color:aquamarine; font-weight:bold";>My name is Davita, and I made aliyah to Israel just two months ago. There is a lot more to know about me, but for now, my being an olah chadasha is an integral part of who I am. </p>
    <p>I live in a city called Karmiel in the North of Israel, where you can find shops, shuls, parks, doctors offices, and anything else you might need, while still always feeling just a little bit <em>in the middle of nowhere.</em> From just about any vantage point in the city, you can see beautiful, tree-covered hilltops. The sunsets are forever spectacular rainbows, and cows are frequently spotted just off the road.</p>
    <p>Before making aliyah, I was a teacher and administrator, working specifically with high school girls. What a dream! It's hard for me to imagine a career more challenging or more rewarding. However, I am excited to dive into web design and development! After summer training in engineering to teach a course, and spending many hours with Arduino code and hardware, in additional to many, many, many hours working on text editing, graphic design, and web design, I am ready to take the next step in my education and career.</p>

    <h2>Why web design?</h2>

    <p> My dream is to work with a non-profits or small businesses, and help them grow and increase exposure through web pages that directly meet their goals, and speak to their mission. My career in education has fostered a passion within me to help people, and I can use skills in web design to do just that.</p>

    <h2>Three Important Things to Know about Me</h2>
    <ol class="list"><li>I love grammar and language! </li>
    <li>I can't help being a teacher, even outside of the classroom.</li>
<li>Moving to a new country with a new language - and leaving behind life as you knew it and built it - is <em>really, really hard.</em> I'm excited for this new career path, and also feel like I am stepping off a cliff.</li></ol>

<h2>My Favorite Quote</h2>
<blockquote><p>I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</p>    <cite>Michael Jordan</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a growth mindset is so fundamentally a part of me, and really what it means to be human, that I can't imagine it any other way. My father tells stories about my Grandpa Marcel, A"H, who always just did what needed to be done. We just keep on going, keep on doing what we need to do.</p>
